## Getting Started #

In your flutter project add the dependency:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     cosmos_epub: ^x.y.z
   ```  

Run the command:

   ```yaml
   flutter pub get
   ```    
For more information, check out the [documentation](https://flutter.dev/).

## Usage example
Import the package in your Dart code:

   ```yaml
   import 'package:cosmos_epub/cosmos_epub.dart';
   ```  
First things first, you have to `initialize` databases before using any other method. Kindly, do it earlier, preferably in the main.dart file.

There are various methods to control over book progress DB too for your ease :)

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  // Initializer and methods return a bool
  var _initialized = await CosmosEpub.initialize();
  
  if (_initialized) {
    BookProgressModel bookProgress = CosmosEpub.getBookProgress('bookId');
    await CosmosEpub.setCurrentPageIndex('bookId', 1);
    await CosmosEpub.setCurrentChapterIndex('bookId', 2);
    await CosmosEpub.deleteBookProgress('bookId');
    await CosmosEpub.deleteAllBooksProgress();
  }

  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

To open an EPUB file from the assets, use the `openAssetBook` method:

   ```dart
    await CosmosEpub.openAssetBook(
        assetPath: 'assets/book.epub',
        context: context,
        // Book ID is required to save the progress for each opened book
        bookId: '3',
        // Callbacks are optional
        onPageFlip: (int currentPage, int totalPages) {
          print(currentPage);
        },
        onLastPage: (int lastPageIndex) {
          print('We arrived to the last widget');
        });
   ```  
To open an EPUB file from a local storage, use the `openLocalBook` method:

   ```dart
    await CosmosEpub.openLocalBook(
        localPath: book.path,
        context: context,
        // Book ID is required to save the progress for each opened book
        bookId: '3'
        // Callbacks are optional
        onPageFlip: (int currentPage, int totalPages) {
          print(currentPage);
        },
        onLastPage: (int lastPageIndex) {
          print('We arrived to the last widget');
        });
   ``` 

Also you can use `CosmosEpub.openURLBook` and `CosmosEpub.openFileBook` for your convenience. 

For clearing theming cache, use this method:

  ```dart
    await CosmosEpub.clearThemeCache();
  ```

## RTL Language Support üåç

CosmosEpub now includes comprehensive support for Right-to-Left (RTL) languages such as Arabic, Persian (Farsi), Hebrew, Urdu, and more.

### Features:
- **Automatic Detection**: The library automatically detects RTL content and applies appropriate text direction
- **Smart Navigation**: Navigation buttons automatically reverse for RTL content (left arrow becomes "next" for RTL)
- **Proper Alignment**: Text is properly aligned based on language direction
- **Chapter List Support**: Table of contents supports RTL layout with proper indentation
- **Mixed Content**: Handles documents with both LTR and RTL text seamlessly

### Supported Languages:
- Arabic (ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ©)
- Persian/Farsi (ŸÅÿßÿ±ÿ≥€å)
- Hebrew (◊¢◊ë◊®◊ô◊™)
- Urdu (ÿßÿ±ÿØŸà)
- Pashto (Ÿæ⁄öÿ™Ÿà)
- Sindhi (ÿ≥ŸÜ⁄åŸä)
- Kurdish (⁄©Ÿàÿ±ÿØ€å)
- Dhivehi/Maldivian (ﬁãﬁ®ﬁàﬁ¨ﬁÄﬁ®)
- Yiddish (◊ô◊ô÷¥◊ì◊ô◊©)

### Usage:
No additional configuration is required! Simply open your RTL EPUB file as usual:

```dart
await CosmosEpub.openAssetBook(
    assetPath: 'assets/arabic_book.epub',
    context: context,
    bookId: 'arabic_book_1',
    onPageFlip: (currentPage, totalPages) {
      print('Page: $currentPage of $totalPages');
    },
);
```

The library will automatically:
1. Detect the text direction from the content
2. Apply proper RTL layout and navigation
3. Handle mixed LTR/RTL content appropriately

***Note: I haven't handled all exceptions, so control it on your own side. For example, if you give same bookId to the another book, it can open page and chapter from that book's progress or may break üíÄ***
